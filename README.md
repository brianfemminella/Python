# Python
Python Project: 
These are a variety of python projects that I have worked on that provide an understanding into the differnet funcitonalities of the program. 
Items in this repository range from a menu that allows you to select what you want to eat and a variety of different options for the user to a simple game of rock, paper, scissors. 
Enjoy!
